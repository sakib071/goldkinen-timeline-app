# Task Description

Let's say you are building the frontend for a microservice backend forum website, where you have users and posts.
This is the API to fetch post data - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
This is the API to fetch user data - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
This is the API to fetch post comments - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments

Using these three APIs, you have to build a React UI for a "timeline" of posts.
Each post in the timeline should show the user's name, post title and post body, and you can expand the post and see the relevant comments.
The posts should be sorted in descending order of post ID.
